# Credit Risk Probability Model Using Alternative Data

## Business Problem
Lenders struggle to assess credit risk for individuals with limited credit history. This project predicts default probability using alternative data to reduce risk and expand access.

## Week 12 Improvements
- Refactored modular code with type hints and dataclasses
- Added unit tests (5+ core functions)
- Implemented SHAP explainability (global & local)
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
- Partial dashboard and updated README for non-technical stakeholders

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-model.git
cd credit-risk-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/model.py
